Environment Configuration - While working with APIs, we often need different setups for the local machine or server, the development server, or the production API server. Environments let us customize requests using placeholders or variables so that the API signatures can easily switch between different setups without changing the requests.


Currently I am running them on my local machine. So it should work same in your machine too.


Report - You can find the reports in the folder Target folder/surefire-report. Click on index.html and open it in the browser of your choice.
